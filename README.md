## Program Description

This Management System was built after considering the challenges faced by an actual business, where manual record-keeping has led to inefficiencies in inventory and financial transaction management. After conducting a thorough needs analysis, I identified the urgent requirement for a centralized inventory management solution. This user-friendly interface allows economists, administrators, and workers to efficiently manage their tasks, eliminating reliance on manual records. The system provides real-time updates on product inventory, minimizing inefficiencies and enhancing overall operational performance.
